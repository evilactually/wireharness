First of all, your company is awesome! If I had known about Firefly Equipment and your amazing machines I would've tried to apply earlier. I don't have any relevant professional experience(my most recent job was working as a mailman). Neither I have any particular qualifications, nor much in formal education. And if I just sent you my bare resume, you would have all the right to ignore me. But no! I made a sample project to demonstrate my technical ability. You will find the description of the project in the link below. In addition I just mailed to you the actual wire harness that I have constructed, together with my resume. It's not a real wire harness, it's not made for any car in particular, because of the difficulty of finding the right connector housings. I just wanted to build something that has at least some of the real world constraints, but not so much, that it would stall the project for months, while I shop for rare parts.

I chose a car power seat as a subject, simply because like most people I happen to have a spare one laying under my bed.
